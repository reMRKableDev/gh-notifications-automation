This repo contains a script that automates the process of checking GitHub notifications and marking merged or closed PRs/issues as **_"done."_**

The script uses the GitHub API to streamline the workflow for developers managing large volumes of notifications.

## üîß Features

- Automatically fetches all unread GitHub notifications.
- Filters notifications for:
  - Closed Issues
  - Merged Pull Requests
- Marks processed notifications as "done."
- Skips notifications for organization-owned repositories (processes only personal repositories).
- Fully automated via GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The script fetches unread notifications using the GitHub API.
2. It filters notifications:
   - Only considers your personal repositories (skips organization-owned repos).
   - Processes notifications related to Pull Requests or Issues.
   - Checks if the PR/Issue is closed or merged.
3. Marks filtered notifications as done via the GitHub API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-notifications-automation.git

cd github-notifications-automation
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Using yarn

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```plaintext
GH_PAT=your-personal-access-token

```

**Note:** You can generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the notifications scope in your GitHub account settings.

### 4. Run Script Locally

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn start

# Using npm
npm start
```

## üìú Automate with GitHub Actions

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow to run the script periodically in the cloud.

### How to Set Up the Workflow

1. Add the following GitHub Secrets to your repository:
   - `GH_PAT` ‚Üí Your GitHub Personal Access Token.
   - `GH_USERNAME` ‚Üí Your GitHub username.
2. The included workflow (`auto-mark-done.yml`) will:
   - Run the automation every hour.
   - Process notifications and mark them as **_"done."_**

## üö® Testing
